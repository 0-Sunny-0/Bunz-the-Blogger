# Bunz The Blogger

## Description

Just a blog weebsite for the gal that might have something to say.<br>
Upon loading the page, you will be met with a form that will allow you to add a blog submission. After pressing submit, the page will redirect to the blog landing page, which will show you a list of submitted blog entries.<br>Hope you enjoy random thoughts from my wee little mind. &#128526;
